# ScriptsArchive

## Archive Notes

At this point, this curated library of scripts is organized by previous projects to help me remember what kinds of features and functionalities those games had. 
There are a lot of scripts that overlap (Like there are multiple of similar names but in different projects) since as I learned more about them, I kind of built upon the previous files in order to make them work better for different games (like GameManager).

Once I have a better understanding of what scripts I'll need to reuse over and over again, I'll just have script templates made for different functionalities that I can reuse or edit for future games. But for now, this is what we've got.
